Stacks store and retrieve nodes in a FILO/LIFO pattern - First-In, Last-Out. If you stack (push) three objects `first` `second` and `third` in that order, then retrieve (pop) one item, it will be `third`.

Queues store and retrieve nodes in a FIFO/LILO pattern - First-In, First-Out. If you queue (enqueue) three objects `first` `second` and `third` in that order, then retrieve (dequeue) one item, it will be `first`.
